# Player-Specific Release Optimization Kinematics Model 
This model is an easy-use software that creates a basketball player specific profile taking in play measurements of upper arm, forearm, and hand length. It outputs the sets of joint angles that correspond to a specific release form and also provides ball release properties (ball velocity, ball acceleration, fingertip velocity, fingertip acceleration) useful for the player. 

## Abstract
In the modern era of basketball, the 3PT shot (3PT) has become increasingly relevant to a player's fundamental skill set. At all competition levels, successful implementation of 3PT shooting has transformed offensive schemes and defensive game plans. In recent years, 3PT shooting has correlated to on court success and winning teams, cementing long distance shooting as a desirable and necessary skill. Analysis of early shooting studies focused on the physics of shot release and ball flight, while recent studies examine kinematics of the shooting arm to develop insightful models. These studies debunk the \textit{perfect} shooting form concept. Furthermore, research into standard training regimens to optimize shooting pinpoints the need for a player-specific method supported by quantitative evaluation. This study presents a player-specific release optimization kinematics model novel in its nature. The model inputs individual player measurements and outputs acceptable joint angles of the shooting arm that correlate to desired release parameters as well as specific ball release properties. In emphasizing the model's player-specific nature, this study serves as a baseline for future basketball technologies, training, and performance outcomes. An engineering analysis outlines the background mechanics and kinematics of the shooting arm and ball during flight. A detailed overview provides comparison to current commercial products and market opportunity for the player-specific model, which can transform accepted understanding and implementation of shooting regimens, paving the way for new technologies at every level of the sport.
