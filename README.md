# Player-Specific Release Optimization Kinematics Model 
This model is an easy-use software that create a basketball player specific profile taking in play measurements of upper arm, forearm, and hand length. It outputs the sets of joint angles that correspond to a specific release form and also provides ball release properties (ball velocity, ball acceleration, fingertip velocity, fingertip acceleration) useful for the player. 

## Usage
### Getting Started
Download the files Model.py and basketball_plotting.m and using the terminal navigate to the directory they are downloaded to.

### Requirements
The model was intended to be used with Python 3 and MATLAB. The Python 3 interpreter can be found [here] (https://www.python.org/downloads//). MATLAB can be downloaded [here] (https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/).
